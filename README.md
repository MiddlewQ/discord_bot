# My Discord Bot

Hi this is my discord music bot. First time using a python library to this extent. Would not recommend copying this bot. Based on https://github.com/pawel02/music_bot/

## Commands
Most commands prints its output as embeds. Commands needs a prefix 

1. Help
2. Join
3. Play
4. Multiplay
5. Pause/Resume
6. Queue
7. Remove 
8. Clear - not tested
9. Stop - unstable
10. Playing - not tested

## How to run
A .env file is required with your discord_token and command_prefix

Programmed in WSL, recommend using Docker to build and run it.
